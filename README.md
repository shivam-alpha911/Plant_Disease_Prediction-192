# Plant_Disease_Prediction-192
Plant Disease Prediction Model uses deep learning (CNN) to detect diseases from leaf images. Trained on labeled datasets, it preprocesses images and classifies plant conditions with high accuracy. Built using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch, it can be deployed as a web app to help farmers identify diseases early and improve crop yield.
